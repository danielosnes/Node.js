Challenge Project: Find Your Hat

Overview

This project is slightly difrerent than others you have encountered so far on Codecademy.
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you'll be building.
There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements,
and you should expect to use the internet, codecademy and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

PROJECT GOALS

In this project, you'll be building an interactive terminal game.
The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes,
and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.
