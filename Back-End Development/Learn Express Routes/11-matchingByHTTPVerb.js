/*
Express matches routes by both path and #HTTPmethod verb.
In the diagram to the right, we see a request with a PUT verb and [/expressions] (remember that the query is not part of the route path.)
The oath for the first route matches,
but the mothod verb is wrong, so the Express #server will continue to the next registered route.
This route matches both method and path,
so it's call back is called,
the necessary updating logic is executed and the response is sent.
