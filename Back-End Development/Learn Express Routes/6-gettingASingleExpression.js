/*
Routes become much more powerful when they can be used dynamically.
Express servers provide the functionality with named route parameters.
Parameters are route path segments that begin with [:] in their Express route definitions.
They act as #wildcards, matching any text at the path segment.
For example [/monsters/:id] will match with both [/monsters/1] and [/monsters/45].

Express parses any parameters, extracts their actual values and attaches them as an object to the request object: [req.params].
This object's keys are any #parameter names in the route,
and each key's value is the actual value of that field per request.

/*
In this code snippet, a [.get()] route is defined to match [/monsters/:name] path.
When a GET request arrives for [/monsters/hydra], the callback is called.
Inside the callback, [req.params] is an object with the key [name] and the value [hydra], which was present in the actual request path.

The approriate monster is retrieved be name (the object key) from the [monsters] object and sent back to the client with [res.send()].
